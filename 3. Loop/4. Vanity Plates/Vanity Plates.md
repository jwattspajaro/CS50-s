### Vanity Plates.
#### In Massachusetts, home to Harvard University, it’s possible to request a vanity license plate for your car, with your choice of letters and numbers instead of random ones. Among the requirements, though, are:

* “All vanity plates must start with at least two letters.”
* “… vanity plates may contain a maximum of 6 characters (letters or numbers) and a minimum of 2 characters.”
* “Numbers cannot be used in the middle of a plate; they must come at the end. For example, AAA222 would be an acceptable … vanity plate; AAA22A would not be acceptable. The first number used cannot be a ‘0’.”
* “No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.”
*
**In plates.py**, implement a program that prompts the user for a vanity plate and then output **Valid if** meets all of the requirements or Invalid if it does not. Assume that any letters in the user’s input will be uppercase. Structure your program per the below, wherein is_valid returns True if s meets all requirements and False if it does not. Assume that s will be a str. You’re welcome to implement additional functions for **is_valid to** call (e.g., one function per requirement).

python
    def main():
        plate = input("Plate: ")
        if is_valid(plate):
            print("Valid")
        else:
            print("Invalid")


    def is_valid(s):
        ...


    main()
'''

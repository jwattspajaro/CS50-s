“All right,” said the computer, and settled into silence again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep Thought.
“Tell us!”
“All right,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great Question…”
“Yes…!”
“Of Life, the Universe and Everything…” said Deep Thought.
“Yes…!”
“Is…” said Deep Thought, and paused.
“Yes…!”
“Is…”
“Yes…!!!…?”

###How to Test

####Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python deep.py. Type 42 and press Enter. Your program should output:
Yes 
Run your program with python deep.py. Type Forty Two and press Enter. Your program should output:
Yes
Run your program with python deep.py. Type forty-two and press Enter. Your program should output
Yes
Run your program with python deep.py. Type 50 and press Enter. Your program should output
No
“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”

— The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams

In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting **Ye**s if the user inputs **42** or (case-insensitively) **forty-two** or **forty two**. Otherwise output **No**.

**Hints**
* No need to convert the user’s input to an int if you check for equality with "42", a str, rather than 42, an int!
* It’s okay if your output or the user’s wraps onto multiple lines.

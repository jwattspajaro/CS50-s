### Refueling
#### In a file called fuel.py, reimplement Fuel Gauge from Problem Set 3, restructuring your code per the below, wherein:

âš« convert expects a str in X/Y format as input, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage rounded to the nearest int between 0 and 100, inclusive. If X and/or Y is not an integer, or if X is greater than Y, then convert should raise a ValueError. If Y is 0, then convert should raise a ZeroDivisionError.

âš« gauge expects an int and returns a str that is:

    âš« "E" if that int is less than or equal to 1,
    
    âš« "F" if that int is greater than or equal to 99,
    
    âš« and "Z%" otherwise, wherein Z is that same int.
    
 ```python
    def main():
    ...


def convert(fraction):
    ...


def gauge(percentage):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
#### Then, in a file called test_fuel.py, implement two or more functions that collectively test your implementations of convert and gauge thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_fuel.py

**Hints**
ðŸ”³ Be sure to include

        import fuel
or

        from fuel import convert, gauge
        
atop test_fuel.py so that you can call convert and gauge in your tests.

ðŸ”³ Take care to return, not print, an int in convert and a str in gauge. Only main should call print.

ðŸ”³ Note that you can check with pytest whether a function has raised an exception, 
       per [docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/assert.html#assertions-about-expected-exceptions).

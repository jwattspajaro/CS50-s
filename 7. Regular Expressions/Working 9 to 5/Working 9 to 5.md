### Working 9 to 5
Whereas [most countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_representation_by_country#Time) use a [24-hour clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock), the United States tends to use a 12-hour clock. Accordingly, instead of “09:00 to 17:00”, many Americans would say they work “9:00 AM to 5:00 PM” (or “9 AM to 5 PM”), wherein “AM” is an abbreviation for “ante meridiem” and “PM” is an abbreviation for “post meridiem”, wherein “meridiem” means midday (i.e., noon).

Conversion Table
Just as “12:00 AM” in 12-hour format would be “00:00” in 24-hour format, so would “12:01 AM” through “12:59 AM” be “00:01” through “00:59”, respectively.
